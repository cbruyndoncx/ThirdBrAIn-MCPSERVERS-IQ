I want to make a Model Context Protocol for a to-do app, let's start with the server first. Som basic functionality I'd like is a place where I can make a brain dumb and it will store the data locally with sqlite. Some features it should have are  1) Create to-dos with rough deadlines and urgencies and level of effort (fibonacci) 2) Get the to-dos and their rough deadlines and order them by what to do next (sort by deadlines/then urgencies/then level of effort decending 3) It should split larger tasks into smaller ones so there can be subtasks
